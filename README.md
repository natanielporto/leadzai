# Leadzai's Weather App# leadzai

Hello! Thank you for the opportunity and for looking through my test.

This was created with the minimum ammount of libs as expected. The only one added was Styled-Components, as the project allows and I fell that the code is more well organized in the end. Personal preference.

I know very well that the key is not supposed to be exposed in the app and it's supposed to be in a .env file, since it's a secret. But for easy of use and for your convenience, I left my key on the file.

To run the project, you have to have Node (mine is at 18.17.1), go to the root of the project and run the command ```npm i``` in order to install all the dependencies of the project. After all is installed and ready to go, just run ```npm run start``` in the root to spin up the project.

If you want you can also run the tests that I've made, by running ```npm run test``` in the same root of the project.

### I sincerely hope you like the test and find my implementation as easy to read and straightforward as I invisioned it. Thank you again for your time and opportunity.
